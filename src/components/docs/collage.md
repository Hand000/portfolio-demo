# Collage

   This component was created to fit the design of the website I was inspired by for this project. It does not truly reflect a 'collage'. Much of it's organisation doesn't make much sense and it is due for a refactor.

   Takes an image and displays a caption above it.

## Props

* background: string - Image or subject.
* title?: string - Title on the caption.
* subtitle?: string - Subtitle on the caption, displayed beneath the title.
* caption: string - Full caption.
* left?: boolean - Determines whether the caption is displayed on the left or the right.

## State

This component does not currently have a state.

## Notes

The stylesheet for this component can be found [here](../../style/collage.css).

### [Source code](../collage.tsx)

This component can be greatly improved.
